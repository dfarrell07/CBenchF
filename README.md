## SDN Controller Performance Testing Framework

**This project is very new, under early development. It is not ready for use!**

Note that the project name [is not set](https://github.com/dfarrell07/SDNPerf/issues/1#).

### Overview

This project aims to bring some sanity to the SDN controller performance testing landscape by providing a well architected framework such tests.

Performance tests for controllers are typically one-off scripts written by unconnected developers. They not shared, documented or tested. They don't enable code reuse. They aren't easy to find (many are emailed dev to dev). They don't support multiple controllers.

By providing a framework with a base set of tests, support for multiple SDN controllers, reusable code for working with northbound and southbound devices, a standard results format, stats/graphing tools and support for publishing results to a central location, we hope to dramatically advance the state of SDN controller performance testing.

### Contributing

Contributions are encouraged! At this point, I think most contributions would come as feature requests and use case examples. Please add those to the [Requirements](https://github.com/dfarrell07/SDNPerf/wiki/Requirements) wiki page. If the feature requests are very narrowly scoped they may also be suitable for an [Issue](https://github.com/dfarrell07/SDNPerf/issues).

### Contact

For feature requests, bug reports and questions please raise an [Issue](https://github.com/dfarrell07/SDNPerf/issues). Daniel Farrell is the primary developer of this tool. He can be contacted directly at dfarrell@redhat.com or on IRC (dfarrell07 on Freenode). **Prefer public, documented communication like Issues over direct 1-1 communication. This is an Open Source project. Keep the community in the loop.**
