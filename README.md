## SDN Controller Performance Testing Framework

**This project is very new, under early development. It is not ready for use!**

Note that the project name [is not set](https://github.com/dfarrell07/SDNPerf/issues/1#).

### Contributing

Contributions are encouraged! At this point, I think most contributions would come as feature requests and use case examples. Please add those to the [Requirements](https://github.com/dfarrell07/SDNPerf/wiki/Requirements) wiki page. If the feature requests are very narrowly scoped they may also be suitable for an [Issue](https://github.com/dfarrell07/SDNPerf/issues).

### Contact

For feature requests, bug reports and questions please raise an [Issue](https://github.com/dfarrell07/SDNPerf/issues). Daniel Farrell is the primary developer of this tool. He can be contacted directly at dfarrell@redhat.com or on IRC (dfarrell07 on Freenode). **Prefer public, documented communication like Issues over direct 1-1 communication. This is an Open Source project. Keep the community in the loop.**
